        close to you and to loveo you and to have you love me as well. youre the
        smartest and the most beautiful girl i've ever met, i love when u tell
        me about the things going on in the world and your opinion on
        everything, geniunely ive never met anyone who's as passionate and
        compassionate about these kind of problems as you are and it's so nice
        to see i hope someday i get to be as smart you on these things
        <br />

        I love your voice so much mj i love calling you at night and having you
        fall asleep while im still talking. Even tho we meet so little i relish
        every second we're together istg if there was no one around my hands
        would be on you all the time, you're voice also sounds even prettier in
        person. Your skin feels so ethereal you dont feel real i cant say this
        enough but your skin feels like nothing ive ever felt before i loveeeee
